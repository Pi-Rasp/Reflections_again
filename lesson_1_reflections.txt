How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

using diff -u old_file new_file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can access my previous versions so that in case of errors or anything like this, I can get back to previous version. It also helps with looking the changes what I have done in every change.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

There are many. Not want to write it now. Short in time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Beacuse file can be inter-related and we want to store version of each file when we commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Using the commit ID

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Beacuse I can checkout to my previous commit which was working fine, so I dont have to worry about my new experiment.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For my upcoming projects.
